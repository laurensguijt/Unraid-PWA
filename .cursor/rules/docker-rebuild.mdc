# Docker rebuild after code changes

When you change files that affect the running app (e.g. `frontend/src/**`, `frontend/public/**`, `backend/src/**`, or root `Dockerfile` / `docker-compose.yml`), **rebuild and restart the container** so the user sees the update when using the app via Docker (e.g. http://localhost:8080).

Run from the **project root**:

```bash
docker compose build && docker compose up -d
```

Do this in the same turn as the edit when the change is meant to be visible in the Docker-served app. Use a timeout of at least 120000 ms and request `full_network` and `all` permissions for the command.
